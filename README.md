# Vanilla Cauldron Brewing
A datapack for Minecraft 1.13

## Usage 

To brew a potion, throw the ingredients you would normally put in a brewing stand in a cauldron filled with water. Use Blaze Powder as the "catalyst" once you have all the ingredients. You'll always want to add the Powder last because otherwise it will brew a potion with whatever ingredients are in the pot, even if you haven't finished adding what you want. 

For example, to brew a strong splash potion of health, add netherwart, glistering melon slice, glowstone, gundpowder, and finally blaze powder. 

To get the actual potion bottles, just right click on the cauldron with an empty glass bottle. 

You can only fill up bottles in survival (or adventure) mode. Bottle filling won't work in creative unfortunately. 

## The Trade-off

The benefit of using a cauldron instead of a brewing stand is that it is much faster (and cooler). However, the trade-off is that you have to use a blaze powder per 3 potions brewed instead of the couple dozen[?] you get when using a brewing stand. But honestly, if you have a blaze farm it really doesn't matter. 

## It's Foolproof!

* You can't brew a potion if there's already a potion brew in the cauldron.
* Adding water to to a partially empty cauldron with a potion in it will dilute and destroy the contained potion. 
* You can leave a potion in a cauldron for as long as you want. 
* You only get 3 bottles per brew
* Everything should work fine in multiplayer

## Custom/Changed Recipes

* Strength potions require a blaze rod instead of blaze powder (Example: Extended Lingering Strength ingredients: nether wart, blaze rod, redstone, gunpowder, dragon's breath, blaze powder)
* Poison potions require a fermented spider eye and a brown mushroom as their main ingredients (Example: Splash Potion of Poison II: nether wart, fermented spider eye, brown mushroom, glowstone dust, gundpowder, blaze powder)
* Potion of Luck uses gold ingots as its main ingredient
* Bottle o' Experience requires emeralds as its main ingredient. Yes I added a recipe for this even though its the most useless item in game.
* Potion of Mining requires an iron ingot as its main ingredient. This is a custom potion. 
* More custom potions will be added.

## To Add (Suggestions Welcome)

* More (balanced) custom potion recipes
* Particle effects so you can tell what potion is held in a cauldron.
